The point of this game or simulation is to recreate the ending of the Anime "To Be Hero".

At the time it came out, I did not find any resources to use in the development for this project, so I took it upon myself to make the resources and make them resemble at much as I could to the original show.


Here is the Adobe Illustrator file if anyone would like to have it. There you will find all the game designs and animations.

This is a non lucrative project.
